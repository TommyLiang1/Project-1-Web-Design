      <br /><br />Our <strong>non-profit</strong> mission began in the early
      days of April 2022 when our Graph Theory professor tasked us with creating
      a website supporting any cause and/or need. This website will not only
      provide the reader with great insight on several endangered species, but
      also with the steps necessary to help prevent these species from going
      extinct and how you as a person can help the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, we are four ‘hardworking’ students who deserve an A on this
      project and this website will showcase our ability to efficiently
      communicate and work as a team, resolve issues, and make use of several
      github features. It also will become a starting point for the second
      portion which includes taking the DOM (Document Object Module) of our
      respective pages and creating a graph, adjacency list/matrix, and data
      structure with attributes.
